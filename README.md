Secret project (it's a surprise)

Update (7 years later..) It's not a surprise anymore, here is the video of the production. This repository has the code for the fluid + dual Kinect tracking + particles with the dancers higher up on stage.
The projection mapping on the letters and the cube was done with my multi-projector version of Mapamok which is here: https://github.com/lexvandersluijs/ProCamToolkit.
